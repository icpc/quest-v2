          <p>Every day between December 6 and December 9 visit <a href="https://news.icpc.global/quest">https://news.icpc.global/quest</a> for a set of new daily quests! </p>
          <p>
            Each quest belongs to one of the 7 categories: 
            <ul>
              <li>culture</li>
              <li>networking</li>
              <li>person hunt</li>
              <li>photo hunt</li>
              <li>social media</li>
              <li>solve</li>
              <li>misc.</li>
             </ul>
            Each quest requires a solution of one of the three formats: 
            <ul>
              <li>text (type your answer here)</li>
              <li>photo (upload a picture)</li>
              <li>video (please, try keeping it short ;) ).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>At the end of each day, 2 daily high tier souvenir will be awarded to Quest participants with highest score of that day. Random choice is our tiebreaker. The same person can't win the daily prize twice, but they can be qualified for the grand and special prizes below.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>During the Championship, the Quest Grand Prize will take place among Quest participants with total highest score for quests submitted before 20:00 December 8. </p>
          <br/>
          <p>A very special quest will appear on December 9. The special quest winner(s) will be awarded a very special high tier souvenir.</p>
